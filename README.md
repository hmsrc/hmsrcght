## Welcome

Welcome to Introduction to Git and Github. This is our first time offering this course and we hope to improve the course over time. At the end of the session there will be a link to a course survey; any feedback you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

## Registering for Github

First things first, we should probably register for a Github account if you don't already have one. Registering for Github is free and easy. All we need is a username, email, and password. Github sends a **Verification Email** that may take a couple of minutes, so we should probably get that process started.

Please navigate to [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join). The page should look like the figure below:
