## Registering for Github

First things first, we should probably register for a Github account if you don't already have one. Registering for Github is free and easy. All we need is a username, email, and password. Github sends a **Verification Email** that may take a couple of minutes, so we should probably get that process started.

Please navigate to [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join). The page should look like the figure below:
